When I was on college I learned C, C++, Java, Javascript and PHP in this order. I really enjoyed that languages. I would never imagined that after finish the college I would become in a Ruby lover. 

And all began when I took a course of Python language. I really like the Python syntax, it's very clean and intuitive. I was happy with it, so I started to ask me if I should consider learn seriously Python for web development. So, I choose to learn Django web framework, but I donÂ´t found a book that I desire to read.

And that's it, I remembered that Rails is the most prominent web framework and I found a lot of very cool books. So I decided change my learning way to Ruby on Rails. 

But, Despite I knew Ruby because I wanted to program in Rails. Now I really love Ruby because its a very beautiful programming language.
