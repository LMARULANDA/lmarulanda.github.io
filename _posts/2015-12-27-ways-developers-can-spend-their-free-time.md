Everyone has free time (Maybe it is not much, but they have), that is not different with developers. This post will discuss how developers can take advantage of their free time to improve their programming skills.

## Attend meetups
All main cities are full of many meetups about technology. You should choose a couple of them and attend regularly. Developers can do networking with very nice people that have a lot of experience in the field and people eager to learn. Even, you can give a talk about something you learned. Take a look at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/).

## Read a book
Nothing can replace the pleasure of reading a great book. Books are the most extensive source of information that allows deep in a specific topic.

## Take a MOOC
Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) can remove geographic walls. People who live in cities where they can't find good quality courses can take courses about programming in platforms like Coursera, Edx and Udacity through Internet.

## Watch screencasts and tutorials
Whereas MOOCs are great resources to learn a lot of topics, there is newer or specific subjects which don't have MOOCs available and in that case is a better option go for screencasts and tutorials. Like the famous [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) of Ryan Bates.

## Solve online coding challenges
Programming is all about solving problems. Why not improve problem-solving skills? I think this works like exercises for the muscles. Solving coding challenges regularly should improve your speed and concentration on solving any kind of problem. Currently, I like [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) for ruby challenges and [codefights](https://codefights.com/) for competing against other developers.

## Publish a blog
People really dominate a topic when they can explain it to others. A blog is a nice way to communicate ideas and experiences to a lot of people at the same time. Also, visitors can give feedback to improve. For example, you can explain with code snippets the way that you solve an issue in a project, explaining the tradeoffs and decisions you took.

## Create a side project
How can a developer show mastery in a very new technology or practice? Well, a nice way to show it is through side projects. Also, the impact that your project can reach doesn't have limits. You can show not only your programming skills, but also your creativity and entrepreneurship.

## Contribute to open source projects
Open source projects are a great way to gain experience, read good code and know very experienced developers.

## Answer stackoverflow questions
Being able to answer the most difficult questions about a specific topic is one way to differentiate the gurus from the rest of the mortals. Why not begin to answer questions today? [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is the perfect platform for this.
