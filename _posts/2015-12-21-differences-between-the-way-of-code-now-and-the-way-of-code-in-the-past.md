Coding is evolving each instant. Techniques and technologies we use today are very different from those used by people in the past. Not for nothing, people often say that software engineering is a field where professionals have to continuously learning by themselves.

In the very beginning of the computers, all was binary code (Can you imagine that?). Then, someone had the great idea that of encapsulate the complexity in higher levels of abstraction. That is the way that the assembly language born, but the main thing about this is this pattern of increment level of abstraction continuously through the years.

So we could make a timeline with some languages examples in this way:

> Binary → Assembly → C/Pascal → Java/Javascript → Ruby/Python → X/Y?

Here, we can see how through the time, languages has evolved from the most raw types until make much more easy the work for the programmers nowadays.

So I would like to discuss about the X language. With our hypothesis of the programming abstractions is evolving to manage the complexity and make easier programming, I could think in two branches from distinct use cases.

### X = Frameworks (Rails, Angular, Node.js)
I like to think about Frameworks as languages of higher levels of abstractions that allows us to concentrate on the main functionality and architectural decisions rather than implement common tasks that constantly appears in web programming.    

### Y = Functional programming (Elixir, Scala, Haskell)
A lot of people talk about functional programming. Nowadays it's a fashion. I really feel that functional programming is a great boom. That is going to change a lot of things. The way that functional programming manage the complexity of the problem of parallel / concurrent programming and performance is incredible. (Any person who had performance problems with a rails app knows the painful)

### X+Y
So, if you want to learn about X and Y at the same time, learn about the Phoenix Framework based in Elixir looks like a great alternative for the Ruby guys. The couple Scala/Play! looks very nice too for the Java developers.
